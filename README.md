## Virtual robotics programming


environment that would allow to code instructions for a robot, which would execute the commands in some sort of a visualisation
for young children (our demo; few code options) -> for older students (make visualisations for that)

### AI use

- create a prompt that would guide the student (prompt language level etc. depending on user age)
- write the code for the student from plain language instructions?
- generate features for the robot - maze structures and such
- follow the path instead of maze?
- personality settings

### Tech

- UI - python 
- interpreter of the instructions - python
- LLM - gemini has a free api access
