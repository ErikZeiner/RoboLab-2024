            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8" style="color: var(--text-secondary);">
                The main functionality was built using JavaScript. The site design was done using <a
                    href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a> with an additional package called <a
                    href="https://daisyui.com">DaisyUI</a> and theming was achieved using <a
                    href="https://github.com/saadeghi/theme-change">CSS Theme Change</a>.
                I also used <a href="https://github.com/WebCoder49/code-input">code-input</a> for IDE-like user window.
