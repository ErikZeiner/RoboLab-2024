# TODO

- [ ] menu with more settings
- [ ] regex for matching users input
- [ ] pygame visualisation
- [ ] table for checking validity
- [ ] user usable methods doing visualisation and validity

- [ ] run code if valid basically starts the game, the game runs through the commands
- moving one thing could be pressing the key for a time needed for the robot to move
- keep array with the gameboard and also rescale for the display path
- by giving instructions to which cell in the board to move - rescaling gives final place for the game to move

run input against a python regex, if it passes that 

check
and visualisation on two layers
one simulates cursor movements allowing me to use pygame
one that check against a table representation of the maze

- map backend
- map visualisation
- regex to match users code and 
- more ui to look more done, options and such
- read prompt from file
